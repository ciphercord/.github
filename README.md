# CipherCord

No conversation warrants deprivation of privacy.

<br>

**CipherCord** is a chat application completely reliant on Discord's services. CipherCord turns Discord's hot mess of an insecure, unencrypted platform, and makes it more private.

## How does it work?

When you chat, all your data is packaged up into a little encrypted bundle that is then sent over to a Discord bot with a fully public token.

## Mission

CipherCord aims to be an ironic platform as it secures the insecure nature of Discord.

But more importantly, it aims to be a completely transparent, secure, encrypted platform for your most private conversations to live.

All the source code is listed under this organization and never connects to any third-party websites excluding Discord of course.

## License

Every repo under CipherCord will always be under the MIT license. We believe all code should be free to use and learn from
