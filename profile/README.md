# CipherCord

No conversation warrants deprivation of privacy.

</div>
<br>

**CipherCord** is a chat program which is dependent on Discord's infrastructure. Discord's insecure, unencrypted platform is made more private, encrypted and safe with CipherCord.

## How Does It Work?

When you have sent a message, all of the data included in that message is moved into a tiny, encrypted package and sent over to a fully transparent Discord bot.

## Our Mission

CipherCord aims to be an ironic platform, as it secures the insecure nature of Discord.

More significantly, however, is that it strives to be an entirely transparent, safe, and encrypted platform for your most private conversations.

CipherCord makes it very difficult for you be tracked. Discord collects very large amounts of telemetry; CipherCord tracks no data sent among it's users.

## License

Every repository under CipherCord will always stay under the MIT license. We believe all code should be free to use and learn from.
