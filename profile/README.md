# CipherCord

No conversation justifies deprivation of privacy.

<br>

**CipherCord** is a chat program that is dependent on Discord's infrastructure. Discord's unstable, unencrypted platform is made more private, encrypted and safe with CipherCord.

## How does it work?

When you have sent a message, all of the data included in that message is moved into a tiny, encrypted package and sent over to a Discord bot with a fully public token.

## Our Mission

CipherCord aims to be an ironic platform, as it secures the insecurities of Discord.

More significantly, however, is that it strives to be an entirely transparent, safe, and encrypted platform where your most personal discussions will take place.

Except for Discord, of course, all the source code is listed under this organization and never connects to any other third-party websites.

## License

Every repository under CipherCord will always stay under the MIT license. We think that all code should be open source, free to use and learn from.
